A calming pebble sound app built with Expo React Native. Touching anywhere on
the play screen plays a sound and vibrates the device while your finger remains
on the screen (up to five seconds). Swiping up exits back to the menu. A snow
option is also provided.

## Setup

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and the Expo CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli@7
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Assets

`resources/image/pebble.png` and `resources/sound/pebbles.wav` are simple built-in assets.
`resources/image/snow.png` and `resources/sound/snow.wav` are also provided as basic examples.
Replace them with your own images and sound files for the best experience.
