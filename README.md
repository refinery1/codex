A calming pebble sound app built with Expo React Native. Tapping anywhere plays
the sound of pebbles and triggers a short vibration. A snow option is also
provided.

## Setup

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and the Expo CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli@7
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Assets

`resources/image/pebble.png` and `resources/sound/pebbles.mp3` are placeholders.
`resources/image/snow.png` and `resources/sound/snow.mp3` are also placeholders.
Replace them with your own images and sound files for the best experience.
