A calming pebble sound app built with Expo React Native. Tapping anywhere plays the sound of pebbles and triggers a short vibration.

## Setup

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and the Expo CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli@7
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Assets

`resources/image/pebble.png` and `resources/sound/pebbles.mp3` are placeholders. Replace them with your own pebble image and sound file for the best experience.
